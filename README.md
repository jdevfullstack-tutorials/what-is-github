# What Is GitHub
Before GitHub, software development collaboration
was not that simple. Every proposed changed
will be sent to email because there is no 
centralized site. Imagine if this will be
a collaboration of more than a hundred developers
working at the same time.

It was the same thing when Microsoft Word would 
be used for collaboration. There must be a local
server so that one file could be changed
simultaneously or through WebDAV. But Google Docs
simplified the setup because it is web-based.
GitHub has the same concept. It is a centralized
site where the development actually happens.

Think of Google Docs with purely text and 
the version control is very comprehensive.
That is GitHub. It is mainly for software
development but since GitHub added its own
features, it is not simply a centralized
site for Git.
