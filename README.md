# What Is GitHub
Before GitHub, software development collaboration
was not that simple. Every proposed change
would be sent to email because there was no 
centralized space. Imagine if this will be
a collaboration of more than a hundred developers
working at the same time.

It was the same thing when Microsoft Word would 
be used for collaboration for non-tech documents.
There must be a local
server so that one file could be changed
simultaneously or through WebDAV. But Google Docs
simplified the setup because it is web-based.
GitHub has the same concept. It is a centralized
space where the development actually happens.

Think of Google Docs with purely text and 
the version control is very comprehensive.
That is GitHub. It is mainly for software
development but since GitHub added its own
features, it is not simply a centralized
site for Git.

## GitHub As Hosting Site For Git
This was the very start of GitHub. In order
for other developers to ease collaboration 
through a centralized space, GitHub was
developed. Because of its practical use,
just like YouTube, users
grew every single day.

And since Microsoft saw the potential,
they simply acquired it.

## GitHub Other Uses
Now, the good thing about GitHub is that
it can be used much like Google Docs to
generate document files, provided
it's purely text. 

GitHub is using markdown for the 
README file. Markdown is a lightweight 
markup language
so that you will not be writing using 
the pure HTML for your blogging site, for
example. It's a simplified version so
that you can focus on your content.

The essence of using GitHub just like
Google Docs is that you are not confined
with Google Docs or any other word processor.
Text data can be read by any other machine
that you will be using.

I covered the essence of creating written
content compared to video presentations
like a vlog.

## GitHub As A Social Media
Since GitHub was also intended to be
a social media for developers and non-developers
there are now features like followers
and Discussion feature for a more interactive
approach.

## Use GitHub Without Git
You will be surprised if I say up to now
I did not install Git for GitHub. I am not
using Git. And I am not saying you should not 
use Git. But GitHub can simply be used
without Git, first to simplify your
workflow. 

In tech, there are so many tools for
your different projects. Now, the catch
is that you don't need to use them all.
You should be using them when it is really
needed. For example, a Java framework, like
Spring Boot is an excellent one when
it comes to software development. It is
a shortcut actually. But you don't
need to use it until you really need it.
A simple project in Java will be too 
complicated if you will be using the Spring Boot.
The same is also true for GitHub.

I also covered my simple content dev workflow.
