# What Is GitHub

*`updated 21 April 2022`*

Before GitHub, software development collaboration
was not that simple. Every proposed change
would be sent to email because there was no 
centralized space. Imagine if this would be
a collaboration of more than a hundred developers
working at the same time. That would be
really hard.

It was the same thing when Microsoft Word would 
be used for collaboration for non-tech documents.
There must be a local
server so that one file could be changed
simultaneously or through WebDAV. But Google Docs
changed that way, it
simplified the setup because it is web-based.
GitHub has the same concept. It is a centralized
space where the development actually happens.

Think of Google Docs with purely text and 
the version control is very comprehensive.
That is GitHub. It is mainly for software
development but since GitHub added its own
features, it is not simply a centralized
space for Git.

Codes are written in plain text but
since other documents are plain text too,
like classic novels, GitHub can be used
for that purpose.

## GitHub As Hosting Site For Git
In order
for other developers to ease collaboration 
through a centralized space, GitHub was
developed. This was the very start of GitHub. 
Because of its practical use,
just like YouTube, new users
flocked every single day.

So using Git and collaborating with
one another was brought to another level
of ease. It is not just like you will
be downloading the project, add your
changes then send it through email 
and wait whether it will be approved.
Using GitHub, it is already on one
online space.

## GitHub Other Uses
Now, the good thing about GitHub is that
it can be used much like Google Docs to
generate document files, provided
it's purely text. Examples of pure text
content are classic novels, law articles,
and complex tutorials. Take note,
even though it's pure text, Markdown
can embed pictures and gifs to serve
as visual aids.

GitHub is using Markdown for the 
README file. Markdown is a lightweight 
markup language
so that you will not be writing using 
the pure HTML for your blogging site, for
example. It's a simplified version so
that you can focus on your content.

The essence of using GitHub just like
Google Docs is that you are not confined
with Google Docs or any other word processor.
Text data can be read by any other machine
that you will be using.

I covered the essence of creating written
content compared to video presentations
like a vlog:

With this, while you are creating your 
digital content, every change will be counted
as a commit, thereby making your GitHub profile
a good one.

## GitHub As A Social Network
Since GitHub is also intended to be
a social network for developers and non-developers,
there are features like followers
and discussion for a more interactive
approach.

## Use GitHub Without Git
You will be surprised if I say up to now
I did not install Git for GitHub. I am not
using Git. And I am not saying you should not 
use Git. But GitHub can simply be used
without Git to simplify your
workflow. 

In tech, there are so many tools for
your different projects. Now, the catch
is that you don't need to use them all.
You should be using them when it is really
needed. For example, a Java framework, like
Spring Boot is an excellent one when
it comes to software development. It is
a shortcut actually. But you don't
need to use it until you really need it.
A simple project in Java will be too 
complicated if you will be using the Spring Boot.
The same is also true for GitHub.

I also covered my simple content development
workflow here:

## GitHub Jargon Terms
The very first time I encountered GitHub, 
I was prompted by these jargon terms:

`commit` - it is a revision or
an individual change to a file
including word deletions or deleting 
the file/s.

`fork` - a copy of a repository. Changes can
be made without affecting the original
repository. A pull request should be
created so that changes can be merged.
A pull request can be simply not merged
in the main branch, it is the repo's
original author/s to decide.

`GitHub Gist` - another feature of
GitHub. It is considered a lightweight
repo but still has all the features
for Git. It can be used as a mini-blogging
site, for others can actually comment
on your project or idea. It can
be used to share code snippets, just
like Pastebin.

`GitHub Pages` - another add-on
for GitHub repo to be turned into a 
static website. This has so many 
applications like you can embed
the file on another site or be your
blogging site.

`pull request` - a request for the author/s
of a repo to have the proposed change/s
be accepted in the `main` branch.

`repository` - think of it as a Google Drive folder
where your files reside.
There can be subfolders
for software development folder structure.

There is the README file
as the description of your project. 
This is the 
default page displayed once you visit
a repo. This is also your default page
when you deployed GitHub Pages from
the `main` repository.

`repository branch` - branches can
be made so that if ever author/s
wish to change something without
the fear of ruining the project,
it should be done in a branch.

## Your First Steps
So what are you waiting for! Join GitHub, it's free.

<https://github.com/join>

Then create your very first repo by going to your profile

<https://github.com/[yourusername]>

then click `Repositories` tab, then you'll see the 
`New` button

or

go to your dashboard 

<https://github.com/>

at the left side you will be seeing the `Repositories`
section click `New`.

Also, to practice copying another repo, 
if you are viewing this as a page, click
the button `View On GitHub` button on top
and when you are already on GitHub, 
at the upper right corner you'll
see `Fork` button. Simply click it
and you will have the copy of this repo!
